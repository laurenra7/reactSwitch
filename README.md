## Development and contribution

1. Install NPM package dependencies by using: `npm install`. If you use NPM 
v7.x.x, which can be checked by executing `npm -v`, execute: 
`npm install --legacy-peer-deps`.
2. If you want it to have `npm run build` or `npm start` automatically copy the 
bundled widget .mpk file to your Mendix project directory (into the `widgets` 
subdirectory), modify the `projectPath` under `config` in `package.json`.
3. Run `npm start` to watch for code changes. On every change:
    - the widget will be bundled;
    - the bundle will be included in a `dist` folder in the root directory 
of the project;
    - the bundle will be included in the `deployment` and `widgets` folder 
of the Mendix test project.
4. Or run `npm run build` to just compile and bundle the widget.
5. If your Mendix project is already loaded in Mendix Studio Pro, go to 
App > Synchronize App Directory (F4) to load the updated widget. If you made 
changes that affect the properties of the widget, you will see an error, 
reminding you to right-click on the widget in Studio Pro and select "Update 
widget" or "Update all widgets."
